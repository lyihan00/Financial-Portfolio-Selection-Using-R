# Financial-Portfolio-Selection-Using-R

Using R packages such as Performance Analytics and fPortfolio, this project seeks to generate a optimal set of portfolios to recommend to low, medium and high risk Japanese domestic investors who are seeking to diversify their investments. Backtesting was also conducted with past data, including comparisons of portfolio performance with an equally-weighted portfolio. 

For the purpose of the project, only ETFs were selected for the investment instrument.
